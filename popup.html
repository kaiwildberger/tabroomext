    Hello thank you for using my extension.<br>&mdash;<br>
    i wanted sum keyboard shortcuts and visual fixes to make it a little easier to navigate at speed.
    if you like these too that's awesome :) email me if there's anything wrong with it or if you don't like something or have some minor complaint that i could maybe mitigate.
